    "- https://www.racingchannel.com/archives/CHU/2015/09/CHU150912.HTM has html scrapable data for every race in the last ~10-12 years. Should be sufficient.\n",
    "    - This includes odds as well, which we may want to use.\n",
    "- In order to scrape, we need to know what day the race took place on each track, as well as the race number on that day (usually 10-12 races per day).\n",
    "    - https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/race/USA/CD/2013/9/7/7/iroquois-s quickly yields the date and race number.\n",
    "    - We will likely need to manually search for the dates/race numbers for each year unfortunately. This will be approximately 15-20 races each year.\n",
    "- We will need a function which takes in latitude, longitude, and date and returns weather conditions.\n",
    "    - Just simple raining/not raining and temperature."
