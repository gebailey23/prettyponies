CS109 Final Project

We are students at Harvard and created this as our final project for the class Computer Science 109: Data Science taught by Joe Blitzstein, Hanspeter Pfister, and Verena Kaynig-Fittkau in Fall 2015.  

**We had to save some csv’s, such as our traindf and superdf to dropbox, and links are below**
